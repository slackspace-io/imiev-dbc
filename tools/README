These scripts are not polished, and just helper scripts to create the .dbc file.

genDbc.py - Expect to be ran from within tools/ and will create an imiev.dbc file in the same directory. Optionally you can pass the first part of a yaml configuration as $1 to only process that yaml. 
To creaete an entire .dbc from all yamls under pids/
python genDbc.py
To process only pids/0x101.yaml
python genDbc.py 0x101


findNum.py is a hack script to try and 'find' the correct start_bit, size, offset, scale, and endian-ness based on the expected result. Primarily from by hand solving the expressions on the common github for i-miev PIDs or OVMS source code, then configuring this script to try and find a DBC compatible set of options to return the same result. These pids need more testing and verification to ensure the new method is consistent.  This is a brute force, single threaded, nested for loop nightmare. Mainly checking it in so I can continue this work on my other computers when traveling. 


The only deliverable in this repo is meant to be the imiev.dbc in the root folder, the rest is either tools to create the DBC, notes, or helper scripts.
